# Mini-MLProject
Vehicle Detection using OpenCv
The OpenCV (cv2) module supports computer vision and deep learning.  The objective of this vehicle driving Python project is detection of a vehicle in video frames. In addition, the vehicles will be tracked within each frame.

Vehicle Detection Advantages

Vehicle detection reliability offers advantages for site safety and traffic control. Identifying the perfect technology for your requirements can be challenging for a vehicle detection application. Some of the factors that can play a major role in the success of a vehicle detection system are application environment (indoors or outdoors) , sensor mounting,  sensing range, and target size.

The Video and the classifier file has been uploded in the repository but its not neccessary to use the same video or classifier you can use your own video and classfiler just by changing the file path in the code 

Some Screenshots are uploded for your reference
